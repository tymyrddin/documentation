# User manuals

[![RTFM](img/rtfm.png)](https://xkcd.com/293/)

User manuals are on what a software does and how to use it. What follows are too many meetings, wordy emails, tiring video calls, and more confusing explanations. Key is to communicate effectively with illustrations and maybe some video recordings. Using recognisable templates with examples of the various uses of the software helps too. 

## Context

What does someone have to do to get "this" and "that", things the software is supposed to do for a user? The written communication varies from verbose to concise. Examples: [Sphinx Documentation](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/contents.html) and [The Linux man-pages project](https://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/).

Acceptance test: Someone new to the project, not necessarily a developer, can use the code with help of the manual.

## Guides

* Lay out usage examples step-by-step
* Include plenty of diagrams and illustrations
* Usually contains: 
  * minimum hardware and software requirements
  * installation/setup guide and instructions on how to start the system (possibly in the form of a [quickstart](quickstarts.md))
  * description of main features
  * instructions on how to use the system
  * cautions and warnings
  * [Troubleshooting steps](troubleshooting-guides.md) with examples of the most common error messages
  * contact information in case undocumented questions arise
