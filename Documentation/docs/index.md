# Documentation

Documentation is an art. A skill we do not undervalue, and think we could be better at. Too little documentation, and 
noone else might get the thing running, let alone use it. Documenting everything down to the nitty-gritty details no 
good either! No one will read it. And the more writing there is, the more artful, accurate and unambiguous it needs to 
be, and the more time and energy it will take to maintain it.

## Common problems

- Parts of the documentation are outdated/incomplete
- Documentation workflows undocumented
- We typically program first and document later (or never). We had a test-driven revolution. What if we have a documentation-driven revolution to follow up on that?
- There is no manual for developers (first steps, call tree, where to start, what to do and what not to do)
- One documentation for different versions (either just confusing or documentation for older versions is just dropped)
- New people have to read a lot of text in different places just to get started
- Keyword-driven (what is possible) instead of tutorial-driven (what is recommended)
- With some projects it is impossible to get a result after 5 minutes of reading
- Some projects even take pride in being inaccessible, hard to understand, undocumented, and opaque
