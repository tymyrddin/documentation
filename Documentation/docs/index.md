# Documentation 

Documentation is an art. A skill we do not undervalue, and think we could be better at. Too little documentation, and 
noone else might get the thing running, let alone use it. Documenting everything down to the nitty-gritty details no 
good either! No one will read it. And the more writing there is, the more artful, accurate and unambiguous it needs to 
be, and the more time and energy it will take to maintain it.
