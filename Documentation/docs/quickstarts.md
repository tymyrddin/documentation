# Quickstarts

## Context

All QuickStarts and README's try to get a developer started as soon as possibleâ€”but there aren't any industry standards for how that can be achieved. 

Acceptance test: Developers can set themselves up to work on the code with the required suite of tools (tests, linters, etc.), without assistance.

## Guides

The two most effective ways to "QuickStart" a developer:

* Include the basics with some language-agnostic commands that can be run immediately. In the case of [an API](automated-docs.md), this can be done using curl or Postman and lets the developer get their feet wet, with no setup necessary.
* Shorten the time to a first "hello world" with things like SDKs, wrappers, or even packages with sample projects, paired with a short tutorial. 

The more steps involved in a QuickStart, the fewer developers will try their hand at it. On the other hand, the more specific a QuickStart is to a developer's use case, the more likely they are to see its relevant value.
