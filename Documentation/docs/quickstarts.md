# Quickstarts

## Context

Quickstarts are on how to get code up and running. Is there any IDE setup that needs to be done? What are the necessary environment variables? How to run the tests? Usually this all goes into "Quickstarts" and README's, serving a wide range of skills, with attention for details, in a list of sequential directions, with illustrations.

Acceptance test: Another person can set themselves up to work on the code with the required suite of tools (tests, linters, etc.), without assistance.
