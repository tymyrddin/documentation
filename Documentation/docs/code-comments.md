# Code comments

> “if your code needs comments, it’s not clear enough on its own.”

Utter bullocks. And self-defeating.

## Context

When senior and junior people join the team, when you come back to the code after a few weeks or more.

## Guides

* Do not comment the obvious. Use variable names that make the obvious more obvious.
* When doing something that no variable name can make obvious (complicated algorithms), provide comments as headers in the logic.
* If someone is likely to come along and see code they could think needs changing, leave a comment explaining why to leave it like this.
