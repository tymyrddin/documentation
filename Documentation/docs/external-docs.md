## Quickstarts

Quickstarts are on how to get code up and running. Is there any IDE setup that needs to be done? What are the necessary environment variables? How to run the tests?  

Usually this all goes into "Quickstarts" and README's, serving a wide range of skills, with attention for details, in a list of sequential directions, with illustrations.

Acceptance test: Another person can set themselves up to work on the code with the required suite of tools (tests, linters, etc.), without assistance.


## User manuals

User manuals are on what a software does and how to use it. What does someone have to do to do "this" and "that", things the software is supposed to do for a user. 

Takes on user manuals and man page formats. Examples: [Doclify Documentation](https://doclify.io/docs/guide/) and [The Linux man-pages project](https://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/) The user manual format is intended for users and are more comprehensive and contain illustrations where necessary, the second are for other developers and are extremely concise. 

What follows are too many meetings, wordy emails, tiring video calls, and more confusing explanations. Key is to communicate effectively with illustrations and maybe some video recordings. Using recognisable templates with examples of the various uses of the software helps too. 

Acceptance test: Someone new to the project can use the code, without assistance.
